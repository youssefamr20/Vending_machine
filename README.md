# Vending_machine
A univeersity project of a vending machine 
Synthesis , DFT and PnR were made using alliance tools. 

Description:
• User enters money: 0$, 0.25$, 0.5$, 1$ , and selects if he wants water
(0.5 $) or soda (1.25 $) using the button “water_soda”, it will be
pressed if the user wants soda instead of water.

In the repisotery there is  our design and testbench 
then we have 2 additional .VHD files contain the design after synthesis and inserting scan chains and testbench that compares between the design after
synthesis and scan insertion and the original dataflow modeling.

Here is a view of the FSM :
